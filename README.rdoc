This is my attempt at creating a movie review app for cs424.  It consists of 3 scaffolds,  films, users, and ratings and uses a 'raty' 5 star rating system.  

However there seems to be major problems with the review and film controllers that is beyond my comprehension on ruby on rails.  

I do not know whether I have gone wrong somewhere far back in the construction of the app or whether it is mearly a syntax error.  But it does not allow access to the review page or to the show film page.
